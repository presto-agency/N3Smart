        <h4>
          Introduction
        </h4>
         <p>
           N3 Norge AS works to have a sustainable business practice that respects people, society and the environment. This policy document, including principles for sustainable business practices, forms the basis of our sustainability work.
         </p>
         <p>
           N3 Norge AS considers sustainable business practices as a prerequisite for sustainable development, which means that current generations have their needs covered without destroying future generations' ability to have theirs covered [1] . The UN's sustainability goals are the world's joint action plan for sustainable development. N3 Norge AS works actively with the sustainability goals.
         </p>
         <p>
           As a member of Ethical Trade Norway, N3 Norge AS is committed to working actively with due diligence assessments for sustainable business practices. [2] Caution assessments are a risk-based approach to respecting and safeguarding people, society and the environment in our own business and in the entire supply chain. We expect our suppliers and partners to follow the same approach.
         </p>
         <h4>
           Requirements for own business
         </h4>
         <p>
           N3 Norge AS recognizes that our business practices can have a potential negative impact on people, society and the environment. At the same time, we see our potential to contribute to positive development in the supply chain. Based on this, we have prepared the following principles and requirements for our own business:
         </p>
         <h4>
           Caution assessments
         </h4>
         <p>
           3 Norge AS shall carry out due diligence assessments for sustainable business practices. That is: make your own risk assessments of negative impact on people, society and the environment, and stop, prevent and reduce such impact. The measures are monitored and the effect of is assessed, and communicated to those affected. Where our activities cause or contribute to a negative impact on people, society or the environment, we will stop this activity, and we will seek to repair the damage. Where the supplier is responsible for the negative impact / damage, the supplier is also responsible for recovery. [3]
         </p>
         <h4>
           Responsible purchasing practice
         </h4>
         <p>
           N3 Norge AS considers responsible purchasing practice to be one of our most important tools in the work for sustainable business practice. N3 Norge AS shall adapt our own procurement practices so that we strengthen, and not undermine, suppliers' ability to deliver on the requirements we set to ensure good conditions for people, society and the environment. We will strive for long-term supplier relationships with suppliers who show particular willingness and ability to work with positive development in the supply chain.
         </p>
         <h4>
           Free trade union organization and worker representation
         </h4>
         <p>
           N3 Norge AS supports the right to free trade union organization and other forms of democratically elected workers' representation. We will involve workers' representatives and other relevant stakeholders in our work with sustainable business practices.
         </p>
         <h4>
           Supplier development and partnership
         </h4>
         <p>
           In dialogue with suppliers, we will, if necessary, consider contributing with relevant competence development or resources that enable our suppliers to comply with N3 Norge AS 'requirements for conditions in the supply chain. In this way, we lay the foundation for good collaboration with suppliers who show particular willingness and ability to work with positive development for people, society and the environment in the supply chain.
         </p>
         <h4>
           Requirements for reservations in the supply chain
         </h4>
         <p>
           We expect our suppliers and partners to work purposefully and systematically to comply with our supplier guidelines, including principles for sustainable business practices, which cover basic requirements for human rights, employee rights, anti-corruption, animal welfare and the environment. Our suppliers must:
         </p>
         <ul>
           <li>
             Follow vendor guidelines , including principles for sustainable business practices.
           </li>
           <li>
             Work actively with due diligence assessments, ie: make your own risk assessments for negative impact on people, society and the environment, and stop, prevent and reduce such impact. The measures must be monitored and the effect assessed, and communicated to those affected. Where the supplier is responsible for the negative impact / damage, the supplier is also responsible for recovery. [4]
           </li>
           <li>
             Demonstrate the will and ability for continuous improvement for people, society and the environment through collaboration.
           </li>
           <li>
